      <strong>rick's trollcave</strong><br><br>
      years ago, a traveller named heidi, wandered near the trollcave, going behind its bizzare wonders, the shrubs of mystery greeted her with rustling secrets, and a sus hole that marked "elvis presley is def not hiding here."<br><br>
      but true danger arrived soon as heidi spotted a really big dune and next to it a dark cave, as curiosity sparked, and she stepped foot in the trollcave, from where no man or woman ever came back alive, it was just endless rickrolls...<br><br>
      the traveller was never found again, its said, that you'll still hear her singing along. you were warned.
